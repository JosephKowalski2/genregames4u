While browsing your favorite gaming marketplace I’m sure you have seen it recommend games for you based on ones you have viewed or bought. While those aren’t bad, wouldn't it be better to be able to view games in a specific genre that you would want to see?

This project aims to build a video game recommender that will take a genre of games or game title and return at least 20 games that are in that same genre that are rated above a certain threshold.

My idea is that it won’t return the same 20 games each time. Some games may be repeated but the list will always be in a random order with a random assortment of titles.

This idea may be expanded on or changed depending on research and what the program needs are. The idea may be expanded upon as work on the project continues.

The tools I plan to use are python, pandas, and jupyter notebooks to visualize the data. More tools may be used as the project progresses.
